  The visually impaired, especially the elderly, face major challenges in mobility and health management. Dependence on others for daily activities causes emotional stress and loss of independence. Our motivation was to build a device that empowers these individuals by improving safety, health monitoring, and emergency responsiveness.
We wanted to develop an all-inclusive solution that:
1. Enables Safe Mobility: Through obstacle detection and effective navigation for users.
2. Monitors Health: Tracks heart rate to provide vital health insights for elderly users.
3. Enables Quick Assistance: An emergency SOS button allows users to seek help immediately when needed.

FEATURES
Obstacle Detection: Detects nearby obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.
Heart Rate Monitoring: Continuously tracks vital signs with a pulse sensor.
Emergency SOS Button: Alerts caregivers or emergency contacts when triggered.

COMPONENTS
Hardware: Ultrasonic Sensor, Pulse Sensor, SOS Button, Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
Software: Arduino IDE, Sensor Libraries.
