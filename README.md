  The visually impaired, especially the elderly, face major challenges in mobility and health management. Dependence on others for daily activities causes emotional stress and loss of independence. Our motivation was to build a device that empowers these individuals by improving safety, health monitoring, and emergency responsiveness.
We wanted to develop an all-inclusive solution that:
1. Enables Safe Mobility: Through obstacle detection and effective navigation for users.
2. Monitors Health: Tracks heart rate to provide vital health insights for elderly users.
3. Enables Quick Assistance: An emergency SOS button allows users to seek help immediately when needed.
PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Mobility Issues: Ultrasonic sensors help detect obstacles for safe navigation.
Health Risks: Real-time heart rate monitoring helps identify health problems early.
Emergency Situations: The SOS feature ensures users can send alerts during emergencies, reducing response time.
